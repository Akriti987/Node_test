why do we need package.json (V28)

 npm - global command,comes with Node
 npm --version
local dependency - use it only in this particular project 
npm i <packageName>

global dependency - use it in any project
npm install -g <packageName>
sudo npm install -g <packageName> //in mac credentials will be 
asked while installing a package

//npm init
//npm init -y (faster)
//by initializing npm we get package.json file which is used to keep 
information related to all our installed packages as dependencies in it.
(eg: npm i lodash)
Also npm creates node modules folder ..whic again contains the dependency folder
(eg lodash).

                       we are sharing our code to other developers
